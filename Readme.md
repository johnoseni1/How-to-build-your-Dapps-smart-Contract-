# How to write smart contracts


- ## write Comments in Solidity?

You can write single line comments and multi-line comments in solidity using // and /** ... */

samples like 

``` 
    // Single Line comment in solidity

    /* 
    Multi-line comment in solidity
    */
```

> A single-line comment is terminated by any unicode line terminator (LF, VF, FF, CR, NEL, LS or PS) in utf8 encoding. The terminator is still part of the source code after the comment, so if it is not an ascii symbol (these are NEL, LS and PS), it will lead to a parser error.
